<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>John Gilpin was a citizen</p>
<p class="i2">Of credit and renown,</p>
<p>A train-band captain eke was he,</p>
<p class="i2">Of famous London town.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,</p>
<p class="i2">&quot;Though wedded we have been</p>
<p>These twice ten tedious years, yet we</p>
<p class="i2">No holiday have seen.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;To-morrow is our wedding-day,</p>
<p class="i2">And we will then repair</p>
<p>Unto the 'Bell' at Edmonton,</p>
<p class="i2">All in a chaise and pair.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;My sister, and my sister's child,</p>
<p class="i2">Myself, and children three,</p>
<p>Will fill the chaise; so you must ride</p>
<p class="i2">On horseback after we.&quot;</p><a name="Page_4"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0004.jpg" width="380" height="273" align="middle" alt="The Linendraper bold" title=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He soon replied, &quot;I do admire</p>
<p class="i2">Of womankind but one,</p>
<p>And you are she, my dearest dear,</p>
<p class="i2">Therefore it shall be done.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;I am a linendraper bold,</p>
<p class="i2">As all the world doth know,</p>
<p>And my good friend the calender</p>
<p class="i2">Will lend his horse to go.&quot;</p><a name="Page_5"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, &quot;That's well said;</p>
<p class="i2">And for that wine is dear,</p>
<p>We will be furnished with our own,</p>
<p class="i2">Which is both bright and clear.&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>John Gilpin kissed his loving wife.</p>
<p class="i2">O'erjoyed was he to find.</p>
<p>That though on pleasure she was bent,</p>
<p class="i2">She had a frugal mind.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0005.jpg" width="380" height="332" align="middle" alt="" title=""><a name="Page_6"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0006.jpg" width="380" height="437" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza"><a name="Page_7"></a>
<p>The morning came, the chaise was brought,</p>
<p class="i2">But yet was not allowed</p>
<p>To drive up to the door, lest all</p>
<p class="i2">Should say that she was proud.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>So three doors off the chaise was stayed,</p>
<p class="i2">Where they did all get in;</p>
<p>Six precious souls, and all agog</p>
<p class="i2">To dash through thick and thin.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,</p>
<p class="i2">Were never folks so glad!</p>
<p>The stones did rattle underneath,</p>
<p class="i2">As if Cheapside were mad.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>John Gilpin at his horse's side</p>
<p class="i2">Seized fast the flowing mane,</p>
<p>And up he got, in haste to ride,</p>
<p class="i2">But soon came down again;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>For saddletree scarce reached had he,</p>
<p class="i2">His journey to begin,</p>
<p>When, turning round his head, he saw</p>
<p class="i2">Three customers come in.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>So down he came; for loss of time,</p>
<p class="i2">Although it grieved him sore,</p>
<p>Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,</p>
<p class="i2">Would trouble him much more.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0007.jpg" width="380" height="244" align="middle" alt="The 3 Customers" title=""><a name="Page_8"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0008.jpg" width="380" height="272" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>'Twas long before the customers</p>
<p class="i2">Were suited to their mind,</p>
<p>When Betty screaming came downstairs,</p>
<p class="i2">&quot;The wine is left behind!&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;Good lack!&quot; quoth he, &quot;yet bring it me,</p>
<p class="i2">My leathern belt likewise,</p>
<p>In which I bear my trusty sword</p>
<p class="i2">When I do exercise.&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)</p>
<p class="i2">Had two stone bottles found,</p>
<p>To hold the liquor that she loved,</p>
<p class="i2">And keep it safe and sound.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Each bottle had a curling ear,</p>
<p class="i2">Through which the belt he drew,</p>
<p>And hung a bottle on each side,</p>
<p class="i2">To make his balance true.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then over all, that he might be</p>
<p class="i2">Equipped from top to toe,</p>
<p>His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,</p>
<p class="i2">He manfully did throw.</p><a name="Page_9"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now see him mounted once again</p>
<p class="i2">Upon his nimble steed,</p>
<p>Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,</p>
<p class="i2">With caution and good heed.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0009.jpg" width="380" height="257" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>But finding soon a smoother road</p>
<p class="i2">Beneath his well-shod feet,</p>
<p>The snorting beast began to trot,</p>
<p class="i2">Which galled him in his seat.</p><a name="Page_10"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0010.jpg" width="380" height="252" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;So, fair and softly!&quot; John he cried,</p>
<p class="i2">But John he cried in vain;</p>
<p>That trot became a gallop soon,</p>
<p class="i2">In spite of curb and rein.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>So stooping down, as needs he must</p>
<p class="i2">Who cannot sit upright,</p>
<p>He grasped the mane with both his hands,</p>
<p class="i2">And eke with all his might.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>His horse, who never in that sort</p>
<p class="i2">Had handled been before,</p>
<p>What thing upon his back had got,</p>
<p class="i2">Did wonder more and more.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Away went Gilpin, neck or nought,</p>
<p class="i2">Away went hat and wig;</p>
<p>He little dreamt, when he set out,</p>
<p class="i2">Of running such a rig.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The wind did blow, the cloak did fly</p>
<p class="i2">Like streamer long and gay,</p>
<p>Till, loop and button failing both.</p>
<p class="i2">At last it flew away.</p><a name="Page_11"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0011.jpg" width="380" height="251" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then might all people well discern</p>
<p class="i2">The bottles he had slung;</p>
<p>A bottle swinging at each side,</p>
<p class="i2">As hath been said or sung.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The dogs did bark, the children screamed,</p>
<p class="i2">Up flew the windows all;</p>
<p>And every soul cried out, &quot;Well done!&quot;</p>
<p class="i2">As loud as he could bawl.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he?</p>
<p class="i2">His fame soon spread around;</p>
<p>&quot;He carries weight! he rides a race!</p>
<p class="i2">'Tis for a thousand pound!&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And still as fast as he drew near,</p>
<p class="i2">'Twas wonderful to view</p>
<p>How in a trice the turnpike-men</p>
<p class="i2">Their gates wide open threw.</p><a name="Page_12"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0012-13.jpg" width="760" height="416" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0014.jpg" width="380" height="368" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And now, as he went bowing down</p>
<p class="i2">His reeking head full low,</p>
<p>The bottles twain behind his back</p>
<p class="i2">Were shattered at a blow.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Down ran the wine into the road,</p>
<p class="i2">Most piteous to be seen,</p>
<p>Which made the horse's flanks to smoke,</p>
<p class="i2">As they had basted been.</p><a name="Page_15"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0015.jpg" width="380" height="379" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>But still he seemed to carry weight.</p>
<p class="i2">With leathern girdle braced;</p>
<p>For all might see the bottle-necks</p>
<p class="i2">Still dangling at his waist.</p><a name="Page_16"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0016.jpg" width="380" height="265" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Thus all through merry Islington</p>
<p class="i2">These gambols he did play,</p>
<p>Until he came unto the Wash</p>
<p class="i2">Of Edmonton so gay;</p><a name="Page_17"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And there he threw the wash about</p>
<p class="i2">On both sides of the way,</p>
<p>Just like unto a trundling mop,</p>
<p class="i2">Or a wild goose at play.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0017.jpg" width="380" height="262" align="middle" alt="" title=""><a name="Page_18"></a></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>At Edmonton his loving wife</p>
<p class="i2">From the balcony spied</p>
<p>Her tender husband, wondering much</p>
<p class="i2">To see how he did ride.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;Stop, stop, John Gilpin!&mdash;Here's the house!&quot;</p>
<p class="i3">They all at once did cry;</p>
<p>&quot;The dinner waits, and we are tired;&quot;</p>
<p class="i3">Said Gilpin&mdash;&quot;So am I!&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0018.jpg" width="380" height="226" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>But yet his horse was not a whit</p>
<p class="i2">Inclined to tarry there;</p>
<p>For why?&mdash;his owner had a house</p>
<p class="i2">Full ten miles off, at Ware.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>So like an arrow swift he flew,</p>
<p class="i2">Shot by an archer strong;</p>
<p>So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to</p>
<p class="i2">The middle of my song.</p><a name="Page_19"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0019.jpg" width="380" height="441" align="middle" alt="" title=""><a name="Page_20"></a></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Away went Gilpin, out of breath,</p>
<p class="i2">And sore against his will,</p>
<p>Till at his friend the calender's</p>
<p class="i2">His horse at last stood still.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0020.jpg" width="380" height="366" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The calender, amazed to see</p>
<p class="i2">His neighbour in such trim,</p>
<p>Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate.</p>
<p class="i2">And thus accosted him:</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;What news? what news? your tidings tell;</p>
<p class="i2">Tell me you must and shall&mdash;</p>
<p>Say why bareheaded you are come,</p>
<p>Or why you come at all?&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,</p>
<p class="i2">And loved a timely joke;</p>
<p>And thus unto the calender</p>
<p class="i2">In merry guise he spoke:</p><a name="Page_21"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;I came because your horse would come;</p>
<p class="i2">And, if I well forebode,</p>
<p>My hat and wig will soon be here,</p>
<p class="i2">They are upon the road.&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The calender, right glad to find</p>
<p class="i2">His friend in merry pin,</p>
<p>Returned him not a single word,</p>
<p class="i2">But to the house went in;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Whence straight he came with hat and wig,</p>
<p class="i2">A wig that flowed behind,</p>
<p>A hat not much the worse for wear,</p>
<p class="i2">Each comely in its kind.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0021.jpg" width="380" height="273" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>He held them up, and in his turn</p>
<p class="i2">Thus showed his ready wit:</p>
<p>&quot;My head is twice as big as yours,</p>
<p class="i2">They therefore needs must fit.&quot;</p><a name="Page_22"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0022.jpg" width="380" height="251" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;But let me scrape the dirt away,</p>
<p class="i4">That hangs upon your face;</p>
<p>And stop and eat, for well you may</p>
<p class="i4">Be in a hungry case.&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Said John, &quot;It is my wedding-day,</p>
<p class="i4">And all the world would stare</p>
<p>If wife should dine at Edmonton,</p>
<p class="i4">And I should dine at Ware.&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>So turning to his horse, he said</p>
<p class="i4">&quot;I am in haste to dine;</p>
<p>'Twas for your pleasure you came here,</p>
<p class="i4">You shall go back for mine.&quot;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast!</p>
<p class="i4">For which he paid full dear;</p>
<p>For while he spake, a braying ass</p>
<p class="i4">Did sing most loud and clear;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Whereat his horse did snort, as he</p>
<p class="i4">Had heard a lion roar,</p>
<p>And galloped off with all his might,</p>
<p class="i4">As he had done before.</p><a name="Page_23"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0023.jpg" width="380" height="440" align="middle" alt="" title=""><a name="Page_24"></a></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Away went Gilpin, and away</p>
<p class="i2">Went Gilpin's hat and wig;</p>
<p>He lost them sooner than at first,</p>
<p class="i2">For why?&mdash;they were too big.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0024.jpg" width="380" height="289" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw</p>
<p class="i2">Her husband posting down</p>
<p>Into the country far away,</p>
<p class="i2">She pulled out half-a-crown;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And thus unto the youth she said</p>
<p class="i2">That drove them to the &quot;Bell,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This shall be yours when you bring back</p>
<p class="i2">My husband safe and well.&quot;</p><a name="Page_25"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/j0025.jpg" width="380" height="268" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>The youth did ride, and soon did meet</p>
<p class="i4">John coming back amain;</p>
<p>Whom in a trice he tried to stop,</p>
<p class="i4">By catching at his rein.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>But not performing what he meant,</p>
<p class="i4">And gladly would have done,</p>
<p>The frighted steed he frighted more,</p>
<p class="i4">And made him faster run.</p><a name="Page_26"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Away went Gilpin, and away</p>
<p class="i2">Went postboy at his heels,</p>
<p>The postboy's horse right glad to miss</p>
<p class="i2">The lumbering of the wheels.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p><img src="images/j0026.jpg" width="380" height="243" align="middle" alt="" title=""></p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Six gentlemen upon the road,</p>
<p class="i2">Thus seeing Gilpin fly,</p>
<p>With postboy scampering in the rear.</p>
<p class="i2">They raised the hue and cry.</p><a name="Page_27"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!'&quot;</p>
<p class="i4">Not one of them was mute;</p>
<p>And all and each that passed that way</p>
<p class="i4">Did join in the pursuit.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And now the turnpike-gates again</p>
<p class="i2">Flew open in short space;</p>
<p>The toll-man thinking, as before,</p>
<p class="i2">That Gilpin rode a race.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>And so he did, and won it too,</p>
<p class="i2">For he got first to town;</p>
<p>Nor stopped till where he had got up,</p>
<p class="i2">He did again get down.</p><a name="Page_31"></a>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>Now let us sing, Long live the King,</p>

<p>And when he next doth ride abroad.</p>
<p class="i2">May I be there to see.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
